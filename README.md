# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains various medical attributes used to train a logistic regression model for predicting heart disease outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease dataset, found on Kaggle. It includes the following features:

1. Age
2. Gender (1: male, 0: female)
3. Chest pain type (1: typical angina, 2: atypical angina, 3: non-anginal pain, 4: asymptomatic)
4. Resting blood pressure
5. Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
6. Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1: true, 0: false)
7. Resting electrocardiographic results (0, 1, 2)
8. Maximum heart rate achieved
9. Exercise-induced angina (1: yes, 0: no)
10. Oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
13. Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
14. Target variable (1: heart disease, 0: no heart disease)



## Project Structure
heart.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
Heart Disease.py: The main script contains the data analysis, cleaning, and model training implementation.

## Requirements
Python 3.x, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques. It showcases data collection, cleaning, analysis, and model training using logistic regression.
